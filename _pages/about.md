# Welcome

I am a student in the Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty at Saint-Petersburg State University, Russia. 

My current research areas include Reinforcement Learning with natural gradient descent approaches and different experience replay techniques for RL problems, but I'm also interested in anything about computer vision and Deep Learning, so if you have any interesting idea or want me to join some DL/RL project -- just drop me an email. :)

## Interests

* Reinforcement Learning
  * \+ natural gradient approaches
  * \+ different experience replay implementaions
* Deep Learning
  * Computer Vision
  * Time series
* Computer Science and algorithms

## Projects

* **Tortilla**  
  Tortilla is an Apache Guacamole based project developed to give users access to their virtual machines located on Hyper-V hosts. This project provides a virtual graphical console through RDP/ssh and uses html5 to be available in modern web browsers.  
  It's like a clone of VMware web client, but for MS SCVMM.  
  Contribution: system architecture, system controller (python), scvmm api access (c#), team leading.
* **AvaLearn**  
  Simple client-server app for heavy file hosting and key-based access. Developed for Higher School of Engineering.  
  Contribution: system architecture, server part (c#, .net core), team leading.

## Hackathons & Challenges

* **Junction 2018** -- runner-up (in-team) in QOCO challenge  
  *([PlanPlanner](https://projects.hackjunction.com/projects/junction-2018/5bf841e36a75040015931a95) -- redirecting air traffic with graph algorithms)*
* **World-IT-Planet 2018** -- winner (solo) of the international stage in Cloud Systems track
* **BioHack 2018** -- Special award (in-team) by Institute of Bioinformatics  
  *(predicting 3D cell structure with ML)*
* **Junction 2017** -- winners (in-team) of track "Robots, Learning machines"  
  *([Mirror](https://devpost.com/software/mirr-wait-for-it-or) -- applied ML to Pepper robot to make him copy all our movements)*
* **World-IT-Planet 2017** -- winner (solo) of the international stage in Cloud Systems track  
  *(yes, again :D)*
* **Make your university 20.35** -- winners (in-team)  
  *(recommender system for people looking for a job)*
