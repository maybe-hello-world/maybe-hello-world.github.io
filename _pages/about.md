# Welcome

I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, working under the supervision of Prof. Arpit Gupta in the Systems and Networking Lab.

My current research lies at the intersection of networking, security, and machine learning. Specifically, I
am interested in developing credible ML-based artifacts for different networking and security problems,
and democratizing network research by creating public measurement infrastructures and tools.

I'm leading _netunicorn_ and _PINOT_ projects aimed to simplify developing trustworthy ML solutions in networking 
and make real-world data available for everyone (see [PINOT](https://pinot.cs.ucsb.edu/) and [netunicorn](https://netunicorn.cs.ucsb.edu)).

I also researched a Machine Learning models credibility in the Networking area, exploring vulnerabilities and problems in 
published existing solutions and how to fix them using Explainable AI methods (see [TrusteeML](https://trusteeml.github.io/)).


## Interests

* Machine Learning in Networking
  * \+ ML-based performance inference
  * \+ Explainability and robustness
  * \+ Reinforcement Learning
* Reinforcement Learning in general
  * World Models (including Dreamer) approaches
* Hobby research interests: Deep Space Network and extra-terrestrial issues in networking

## Projects and Publications
For detailed information on publications see: [Publications](https://maybe-hello-world.github.io/publications/)

* **netunicorn**  
  Our platform, netunicorn, simplifies curating high-quality data for different learning problems from diverse network environments.  
  It also provides abstractions and infrastructure interaction for developers of data collection pipelines and measurement experiments.  
  Contributions: project leading and development.  
  [Website](https://netunicorn.cs.ucsb.edu/)

* **PINOT**  
  PINOT is a real-world networking infrastructure, deployed at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and aimed to
  provide access to active data collection to different researchers. Its uniqueness lies in the usage of the university's public Wi-Fi 
  infrastructure usage for active data measurements from dozens of devices and simultaneous access to anonymized passive data traces on
  the border gateway. Open 4 Research!  
  [Website](https://pinot.cs.ucsb.edu/)

* **Trustee**  
  Trustee is a decision tree -based framework for explainable AI, inspired by the VIPER project. 
  We showed that many public ML models in the networking community are prone to spurious correlations and problems of underspecification, 
  and proposed how to address these issues using XAI techniques.  
  Contribution: public ML models dissection and verification, experiments reproducibility
