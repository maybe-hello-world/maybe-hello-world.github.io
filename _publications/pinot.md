Data collection is incredibly important for computer network research. Meanwhile, obtaining good data is problematic because it requires not only a good and representative infrastructure but also attention to user privacy, data encryption, and the overall efficiency of the solution.

In this paper, we present an example of such infrastructure, built on the base of the campus of the University of California Santa Barbara, and describe what this infrastructure allows to achieve and how to reproduce it in other universities.
